# Ember From Scratch Demo

This repo accompanies my talk at EmberFest 2025.

It walks through configuring a complete, vite-based Ember development environment from scratch, as a teaching exercise.

If you're really trying to build a vite-based Ember app, you will probably want https://github.com/embroider-build/app-blueprint/ instead, since it can deal with automatically converting v1 addons. This demo is carefully crafted to only depend on v2 addons.

## Running it

1. `pnpm install`
2. `pnpm start`
3. app defaults to http://localhost:5173/, and the tests are available at http://localhost:5173/tests/
